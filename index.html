      <h2>Back in 2013,</h2>
      <p>Sébastien, my brother Romain and Boris decided to launch a coding school to teach creative and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech products <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time" target="_blank">through an intensive 9-week bootcamp.</a> At that time, none of them had real design or branding skills. Boris's brother was a lawyer. Sébastien and Boris were both engineers.
         They only knew one thing: they wanted to build a program to teach people the technical skills and tools to bring their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond “becoming a full-stack developer” or “learning UX/UI Design, HTML, CSS, ruby and Javascript”. For them, these skills were also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted to develop tech projects autonomously in their current job, start a freelancing career or launch their own startup. And they felt that traditional degrees’ courses were failing to provide students with these new tech skills. As they say in French…</p>
      <p class="spotlight">L’éducation supérieure a “un wagon de retard”…</p>
      <h2>An idiom that could be literally translated into:</h2>
      <p>“Higher education has missed the train”. This was the first time they thought of the word “wagon” for our brand name. After giving it some more thought, it seemed like a cool name for different reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It points to this idea of a “missing block” or “missing wagon” in the “train of higher education”.</li>
        <li>A wagon is a vehicle that takes a group of people (like a class of students) on a journey to a destination. This is exactly what their coding bootcamp is about!</li>
        <li>They didn’t want a brand name using words like “hack”, “code”, “tech”, “app”, etc… For them, code is a means to develop products and reach your goals, not an end in itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, Le Wagon it was! Vive Le Wagon!</p>
